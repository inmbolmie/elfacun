# Elfacun Chess Interface Module

## Known Limitations

### General operation

Piece sliding is not recommended at this point, you should always lift and place the pieces you move. Future updates could allow or improve piece sliding support.

For taking pieces it is irrelevant if you lift first the taking or the taken piece, it will work both ways. To take back movements where a piece has been taken, you have to undo the movement before placing back the taken piece though.


### 3D-printed case

A custom 3D printed case is provided for the module. It has been designed to be mechanically similar to the original module cases, but adapted to the button and screen layout of Elfacun.

A 3D printed case is easy and cheap to produce for a small-scale project like this, but has some drawbacks:

* Aesthetically will be always worse than a injection-molded case

* The small hooks that fit together the top and bottom parts are more fragile than in the original modules. For that reason the module has an opening on top of the case for the user to have access to the SD card slot and adjustable potentiometers withoud a need to remove the module from the case. So it is better not to try to open the case, or at least being very careful if it needs to be done. In case some of the hooks snapped, it wouldn't affect the module integrity at all, because when inserted into the board slot the two parts will be held in place together anyway.



### Connectivity

Elfacun uses the on-board USB, WIFI and Bluetooth resources of the ESP32 module, so it will be able to connect to any system as far as that system is compatible with the ESP32 WIFI and Bluetooth modes. More details can be found here:

[http://esp32.net/](http://esp32.net/)

    Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n/e/i (802.11n @ 2.4 GHz up to 150 Mbit/s)
    Bluetooth: v4.2 BR/EDR and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)



### Passive mode (original Mephisto modules)

The passive mode (the possibility of Elfacun operating alongside the original Mephisto modules) should be considered experimental, and it cannot be guaranteed to work beyond what I have been able to test with my limited resources.

Currently this mode has been tested to work with the following modules and boards:

Modules tested to work:

* Mephisto MMII
* Mephisto MMIV
* Mephisto MMV
* Mephisto MMV 10Mhz
* Mephisto Polgar (thanks to Scally for the testing and report)

Modules tested that DO NOT currently work:

* Mephisto Senator (Unknown reason, thanks to Scally for the testing)
* Mephisto Glasgow (incompatible)
* Mephisto Amsterdam (incompatible)
* Mephisto Dallas (incompatible)
* Mephisto Roma (incompatible)

Boards tested to work:

* Mephisto Exclusive 
* Mephisto Modular 
* Mephisto MÃ¼nchen
* Mephisto Impos Royal (Thanks to Scally for the testing)

In all the cases **the original modules have been powered from the board**, while Elfacun has to be powered from USB. It is important to power up the Mephisto module before powering up Elfacun, so that Elfacun can detect that the module is operating while it is starting up.

Elfacun needs dedicated hardware to be able to capture the communication between the original module and the board. That data capture is timing-critical, and different modules will have different timings that cannot be predicted and have to be measured on the real hardware. The board scanning and LED driving signals needs also to be differentiated for proper operation, and modules beyond those that have been tested could operate differently, and be not compatible with the current implementation.

There are a couple of potentiometers on-board that can be adjusted to try to compensate for timing differences up to a point but that doesn't provide a total guarantee that you will be able to adjust them to operate with any module.

Te critical timings are:

* Short delay, that is the delay from the time row data is available to the time we can start to capture column data
* Long delay, that is the time we will wait since we end capturing column data until we can start the capture process for the following row.

That delays can be adjusted with the RV2 and RV3 variable resistors

The default adjusted values are:

* RV2: 10Kohm (long delay)
* RV3: 3Kohm (short delay)

I would like to have the possibility to test mode modules in the future, but then original modules are expensive, specially 16 and 32 bit modules so it won't be easy to be able to get a significant number of them to test.



### Passive mode operation

Pasive mode is disabled while in Lichess mode, as it would be against their rules to receive computer assistance from a module while in a game.

While in passive mode it can be tricky to fix mangled board positions or take back movements. Think that you have two separate systems (Elfacun and the original module) listening to the piece movements, so anything you make will be applied equally in both sides at the same time, and can be interpreted differenty by the modules if they have different rules. So when in passive mode try to be very careful moving pieces and try not to make worng movements or drop any pieces, because that mistakes could be difficult to fix while in a game.

For pawn promotion, usually the original modules will require you to press a button to indicate the piece you promote to.

In passive mode the original module controls the board leds, so you need to get the opposing movements somewhere else, like in the app you have connected to Elfacun or in the DGT3000 clock messages if operating in DGT mode.


### Lichess mode

Lichess mode is based on the public Lichess Board API. This API has some limitations. Other limitations come from the limited resources available in the ESP32 to implement this mode. These limitations only apply to the native Lichess mode (via WIFI), so if you play Lichess through a connected app (like White Pawn) the limitations don't apply.

The Lichess Board API doesn't allow to launch games with blitz time controls. The minimum recommended time control to play on a board is 10+0 and over. If you try to launch a challenge with an invalid time control from the board, the challenge could be rejected or launched on a different time control.

The Lichess TV stream does not contain game result data, and it would be complicated to make additional requests to get that data, so no game results are displayed in Lichess.tv mode. When a game ends the module will simply start to show the next game.


### Updating software


Software update through USB is not directly supported. Part of the ESP32 module programming hardware has been disabled due to incompatibilities with some apps in Windows when connecting to them through USB. If you ever want to program the ESP32 via USB you would have to manually enter programming mode and reset the module. This should not be a problem to regular users because the module supports software update using the SD card reader.


### PCB

The first version PCB has two patched mistakes that doesn't affect the module functionality, and will be fixed in subsequent releases:

* The buzzer transistor had to be reversed as it was installed in the wrong orientation
* There is a patch wire that enables the bus switches directly from +5V. It was found during testing that the original 3,3V signal was not high enough to enable them in some cases (when using on 6V board power supplies).
