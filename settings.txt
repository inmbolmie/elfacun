#Elfacun settings
#Edit this file (settings.txt) and place it in the root directory of an SD card compatible with SPI mode (most micro-sd aren't)
#Power up the module with the SD inserted (you don't need to have the module inserted into the board)
#The settings will be read and stored in permanent memory
#Remove the SD card and use the module normally
#If you also want to perform a system update place in the SD card root directory the file "update.bin"


#Base MAC address. If not defined, the module will use the default MAC assigned at the factory
#so it is not recommended to modify it unless you have any problem
#Bluetooth MAC will be base MAC plus 2

#Default board mode
#This is the mode the module will boot at by default
#Valid values are: A, B
#Default value is A
#The serial port will operate at 9600 8N1 in mode A
#The serial port will operate at 38400 bauds 7O1 in mode B
#To boot the module in the non-default mode, keep pressed the left-most module button while booting

#Mode A board identification parameters
#Uncomment to get custom board identification values sent to the driver
#mode.a.trademark is an arbitrary string
#serial.number.long has to be exactly 10 characters long

#Buzzer enabled for passive led indications on screen
#Valid values are true, false

#Valid values are true, false
#Default value is false
#When a V2 module starts in passive mode and this parameter is enables, the module will scan for the
#presence of other Elfacun module (V1 or V2) using BLE. If it finds it, it will start a BLE connection to
#relay its LED status, so both modules will be able to control the board LEDs
#It is disabled by default as it only makes sense if you have two modules and with the feature disabled the
#passive mode startup will be faster
