# Elfacun Chess Interface Module

![Elfacun](./images/pic6.jpg)

__News (2022/05/04): Elfacun software version R4 released with some bug fixes: [R4 files](https://github.com/inmbolmie/elfacun/releases/tag/R4)
Installation instructions: [Update Elfacun](./MANUAL.md#update-elfacun-software)__

This is an ongoing hardware project to create a chess module compatible with the old Mephisto modular boards (Exclusive, Modular, München) that will provide connectivity to a wide variety of chess apps and services.

The hardware as well as software developed for it will be eventually published here under the GPL license.

Currently the project is in the pre-release phase. I have a first production model completed with full functionality that will be distributed to selected users. After that I expect to publish the full project and proceed with further development to support or expand the existing user base.

To assist in the release of the first version model, I provide here links to some basic documentation:

* [Module description and features](./DESCRIPTION.md)
* [Updated compatibility chart](./COMPATIBILITY.md)
* [Limitations and remarks](./LIMITATIONS.md)
* [Operation manual](./MANUAL.md)
